# Record Linking

Developing a C program to extract entries from census records to form
a list of potential links in preparation for ML training.

## Usage

To run the program, edit ```src/config``` as needed and then execute ```cd src/ && ./run.sh```. 
This shell script reads the configuration file, sorts the input data (if necessary), and executes the program.
